# Newman Conway Sequence
Newman-Conway Sequence is the one which generates the following integer sequence:\
\
P(n) = P(P(n - 1)) + P(n - P(n - 1)) \
\
Our goal here is to implement this sequence with recursion using 8086 Assembly Language. Result is stored in AX register, 'n' is the value of 'n' in the sequence. In my code, it is 10.
